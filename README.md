### Organize Files

To organize files in a specified directory, use the following command:

```bash
organize 
<dir path>
```

For example, to organize files in your `Downloads` folder:

```bash
organize 

home/user/Downloads
```

<!-- ### Exclude a File Type

You can exclude specific file types using the `--exclude` flag:

```bash
node organize.js <directory_path> --exclude <file_extension>
```

For example, to exclude `.txt` files:

```bash
node organize.js ~/Downloads --exclude txt
```

### Undo Last Organization

To undo the last organization action, simply run:

```bash
node organize.js undo
```

This will revert your directory to its previous state before the last organization.

## Examples

1. Organizing files in the `Documents` folder:

   ```bash
   node organize.js ~/Documents
   ```

2. Organizing files while excluding `.mp3` files:

   ```bash
   node organize.js ~/Documents --exclude mp3
   ```

3. Undoing the last organization action in the `Downloads` folder:

   ```bash
   node organize.js undo
   ``` -->
